pry
  irb++
  http://pryrepl.org/
  key feature: jump into a certain point in your program, check variables

  require 'pry'
  binding.pry


require_relative
  used to run code from another file
  will only load a given file once
  every file that depends on another should require_relative those files

  require_relative "../relative/path/to/file"

enumerables
  http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Enumerable.html
  Array, Hashes (and other classes) are subclasses of Enumerable
    meaning that they all share the methods defined on Enumerable

  #each - do something with each element
    ["a","b","c"].each do |x,i|
      puts "#{i}: x"
    end
    # 1: a
    # 2: b
    # 3: c

  #find - return first thing where block returns true
    [1,2,3,4].find do |x| x % 2 == 0 end
    # 2

  #select - return list with items where block returns true
    [1,2,3,4].select do |x| x % 2 == 0 end
    # [2,4]

  #map - return list with block applied to every item
    [1,2,3,4].map do |x| x * 2 end
    # [2,4,6,8]

  #reduce - block defines how to combine elements into a new object
    very powerful, most other enumerable methods can be implemented w/ reduce
    also called inject (and fold in other languages)

    block is passed in two parameters
      first:
        often called "memo"
        is whatever was return-ed by the previous iteration of the block
        can be initialized by passing a value to the reduce function
          (otherwise, skips first item and uses it as initial value of memo)
      second:
        the current item

    see reduce.rb for examples

    sum:
      [1,2,3,4].reduce(0) do |memo,x|
        memo + x
      end
      # 10

    max:
      [5,1,3,6,2].reduce do |max,n|
        max > n ? max : n
      end
      # 6

    filter:
      [5,1,3,6,2].reduce([]) do |memo,x|
        x > 3 ? memo.push(x) : memo
      end
      # [5,6]

    count occurrences:
      ["a","b","c","d","a","b","a","c"].reduce({}) do |memo,x|
        memo[x] ||= 0
        memo[x] += 1
      end
      # {"a" => 3, "b" => 2, "c" => 2, "d" => 1}




blocks
  seen them used by some methods (ex. #each)
  can make our own methods that take in blocks
    just have to call 'yield()' inside our method
    can only take in one block
  useful to pass in some code/logic to a method

  see blocks.rb for examples

  (ruby also has related things called procs & lambdas, but, sadly, they are rarely used when writing ruby)
